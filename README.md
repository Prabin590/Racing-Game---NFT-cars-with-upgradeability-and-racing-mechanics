# üèéÔ∏è NFT Turbo Racing DApp

## Project Version
**Version 1.0.0** - Initial Release

## Project Description

NFT Turbo Racing is a decentralized racing game built on the Ethereum blockchain where players can mint, collect, upgrade, and race unique NFT cars. Each car is represented as an ERC-721 token with distinct stats, rarity levels, and upgradeability features. Players compete in races to earn racing coins, which can be used to enhance their vehicles or purchase new ones.

The game combines the excitement of racing with blockchain technology, creating a play-to-earn ecosystem where digital car ownership has real value and utility.

## Key Features
